# My First Todo List

My first rendition of the iconic Todo App. this one from the [Kirupa "Learn React" course](https://www.kirupa.com/react/simple_todo_app_react.htm)

I didn't exactly follow the directions for this cause I used the [React workflow with Node, Babel and Webpack](https://www.kirupa.com/react/setting_up_react_environment.htm)

Things I want to do to improve it and get more React embedded in my skull:

## TODO

* Separate components
* Modularize styling with components
* Make items disappear when clicked.
